### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a security researcher and I like reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and exploitation.

I like low-level development and making useful tools. I am currently working on iOS internals.

Please never use the tools or code I publish for malicious purposes. Everything I make is either for **educational purposes** or **community oriented**.

I have recently made private a lot of my public repositories on Github for one or more of the following reasons:

- Not pround of the code I wrote
- Too dangerous to stay public (maliciously exploitable)
- School projects that can spoil the solution for current school students

If you want to contact me you can write an e-mail at: adam.taguirov@protonmail.com.
